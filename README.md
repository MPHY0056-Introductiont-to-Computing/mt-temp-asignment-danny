# Assignment 1: Introduction to GitHub Collaboration

## Objective
In this assignment, you will learn how to collaborate using GitHub by working in teams, making small edits to files, and committing your changes with meaningful commit messages.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Form Teams
- Organize yourselves into **teams of 5–6 students**.
- Teams must have **no fewer than 5 and no more than 6 members**.

---

### Task 2: Assign Roles
- Decide who will be the **team leader**.
- The team leader will be responsible for **hosting and managing the repository**.

- Make **small edits** to the file:

  - Correct spelling
  - Change a word, number, or sentence  
  *(No major changes are required — even a small change counts.)*

### Task 4: Commit Your Changes
- After editing the file, **commit your changes**.
- Write a **clear and meaningful commit message** that describes what you changed.
  - Example: `Fix spelling in ingredients list`

Each team member should make **at least one commit**.
